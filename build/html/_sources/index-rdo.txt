This guide will show you how to install Keystone by using packages
available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and its derivatives through

are included.

   VMs. You will need a desktop computer or a laptop with at least 8
   GB memory and 20 GB free storage running Linux, MaOS, or Windows.
   Please see the
