Keystone Installation Tutorial for openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise
=====================================================================

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

This guide will show you how to install OpenStack by using packages
on openSUSE Leap 42.2 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 - for
both SP1 and SP2 - through the Open Build Service Cloud repository.

Explanations of configuration options and sample configuration files
are included.

.. note::
   The Training Labs scripts provide an automated way of deploying the
   cluster described in this Installation Guide into VirtualBox or KVM
   VMs. You will need a desktop computer or a laptop with at least 8
   GB memory and 20 GB free storage running Linux, MaOS, or Windows.
   Please see the
   `OpenStack Training Labs <https://docs.openstack.org/training_labs/>`_.

This guide documents the OpenStack Ocata release.
