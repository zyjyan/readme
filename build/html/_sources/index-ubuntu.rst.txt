Keystone Installation Tutorial for Ubuntu
=========================================

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

This guide will walk through an installation by using packages
available through Canonical's Ubuntu Cloud archive repository for
Ubuntu 16.04 (LTS).

Explanations of configuration options and sample configuration files
are included.

.. note::
   The Training Labs scripts provide an automated way of deploying the
   cluster described in this Installation Guide into VirtualBox or KVM
   VMs. You will need a desktop computer or a laptop with at least 8
   GB memory and 20 GB free storage running Linux, MaOS, or Windows.
   Please see the
   `OpenStack Training Labs <https://docs.openstack.org/training_labs/>`_.

This guide documents the OpenStack Ocata release.
